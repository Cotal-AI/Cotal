### Patch Changes

- 12ad5e3: Close two attach defects: a capability issued for the wrong agent, and remote attach silently dying after a manager repair.

  **An attach capability could be issued for an incarnation nobody authorized.** `opAttach` resolved the
  agent name, awaited authorization — which on a user mesh performs a ledger read, a real async
  boundary — and then asked for a ticket by NAME. Ticket issuance re-resolved that name and bound
  whichever agent held the slot at that moment. A stop and same-name respawn landing inside the await
  therefore authorized one incarnation and handed out a valid terminal capability for its successor,
  which on a user-auth mesh can belong to a different owner. `url()` now requires the authorized handle
  and refuses when the slot has moved under it, and `opAttach` re-asserts the incarnation immediately
  after the await so the non-pty path shares the invariant. This is the same class as the name-binding
  fix in 0.14.4, one step earlier in the sequence: that closed the window at redemption, this closes it
  at issuance.

  **A manager replacement quietly demoted attach to loopback.** The bind host for the manager's
  attach/console face was passed only on the first `cotal up` and never recorded, so every later launch
  for the same mesh fell back to loopback: a same-root repair, adopting a preserved or restored
  listener, and a `spawn -f` manifest deploy. The broker, the agents, and the mesh all stayed up, so the
  only symptom was `cotal attach` failing to connect from another machine. It is not derivable after
  the fact — a broker dial address is deliberately not treated as a manager bind address — so the
  decision is now recorded on the mesh entry and read back by every manager launch. An explicit
  `--host` still wins, and a mesh that never asked for exposure records nothing and stays loopback-only.

  Also narrows `.cotal/manager.log` to 0600 (new and existing), since the manager's console URL is
  written there and that URL carries a credential reaching every agent's terminal.

### Patch Changes

- ed62069: Stop a slow link from deleting a live mesh's registry entry on connect.

  0.14.3 made the registry _sweep_ (`pruneStaleMeshes`) confirm a failure before removing an entry.
  The connect-time path was left with the original behavior, and that is the one that actually bites:
  `preflightTarget` probes with `probeConnect`, whose default budget is one second, and passes no
  override. That probe completes a full auth handshake — TCP, INFO, then the JWT exchange, several
  round trips — which a perfectly healthy broker across a slow or jittery link (a relayed overlay VPN,
  a loaded host) cannot finish in a second.

  The verdict is destructive: a registry-sourced failure deletes the entry and reports "no mesh running
  (stale registry entry - removed)". Both halves of that are wrong when the cause was latency, and for
  a mesh this machine did not start it is unrecoverable, since only `cotal up` writes registry records.
  Observed repeatedly against a reachable remote mesh whose broker was up the whole time.

  A first probe failure now only makes the target a candidate: it is re-probed with a budget that fits
  a real network before anything is classified or removed. A genuinely dead or genuinely
  credential-rejected mesh reaches the same verdict as before, one extra probe later.

### Patch Changes

- fce3199: Report which machine an agent runs on, and fix three defects that only appear once a mesh spans hosts.

  **`meta.host` on the agent card.** A mesh can span machines: a manager on another box launches
  agents into its own host, so "where is this agent actually running" was unanswerable from the
  roster. Each session now publishes its own `os.hostname()` as `meta.host`, overlaid last like
  `meta.connector` so an agent file cannot claim a host it is not on. It is advisory display
  metadata only, never an authorization or routing input, and the dashboard renders it with no
  change (unknown meta keys already display generically). `SPEC.md` records it alongside the other
  reserved `meta` keys.

  **`cotal up --host <addr>` killed the broker it had just started.** The bind address and the
  broker URL were tracked independently, so `--host` bound one address while the readiness probe
  still used the loopback default. The probe found nothing, timed out, and the caller SIGTERM'd a
  broker that had started correctly, which made `--host` alone impossible to use. The two are now
  reconciled: with no explicit `--server`, the URL is derived from the host; a contradicting pair is
  refused with one sentence instead of starting something unreachable; and wildcard binds
  (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) correctly keep a dialable loopback URL rather than advertising the wildcard. The
  manifest path (`broker.host` without `broker.servers`) had the same defect and shares the fix.

  **One slow probe silently unregistered a live mesh.** `pruneStaleMeshes` deleted any registry
  entry that failed a single reachability check whose budget is 1s, which a healthy broker across a
  slow or jittery link misses routinely. Deletion is destructive and, for a mesh this machine did
  not start, unrecoverable, since only `cotal up` writes registry records. A first failure now only
  makes an entry a candidate; it is pruned only if a second, longer probe also fails. A genuinely
  dead mesh still prunes.

  **A timed-out request killed the whole dashboard.** `cotal web` passed an async listener to
  `createServer`, so a rejection inside any route (for example a JetStream call timing out against a
  slow broker) became an unhandled rejection and took the process down on the first slow request.
  The dashboard is a read-only observer: a failing route now returns 500 and the server stays up.

### Minor Changes

- 02b3243: feat(secret-store): move SpaceAuth (the signing authority) behind the SecretStore seam

  The space trust bundle (`.cotal/auth/auth.json`) is the last and highest-blast-radius durable secret kind. It now flows through the pluggable `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition injects its own KMS/Vault store and no signing seed lands on the hosted disk.

  - New `@cotal-ai/workspace` API: `getSpaceAuth(store, expectedSpace?)`, `putSpaceAuth(store, auth)`, `deleteSpaceAuth(store)`, and `SPACE_AUTH_KEY` (`auth/auth.json`), byte-for-byte the current local path under `workspaceSecretStore`. `getSpaceAuth` validates via the new `@cotal-ai/core` `validateSpaceAuthForRead`, which accepts both a full trust bundle (fully chain-validated) and a stripped signer projection (the `mint --signer`/container form — account keys validated structurally), and never echoes stored seeds/JWTs/space labels in errors. `putSpaceAuth` is the single `sys.signingSeed` strip site.
  - `remintDaemonCreds(root, expectedSpace, store?, { preflight? })` reads the signer through the same resolved store as the daemon cred; `expectedSpace` is required and validated against it. It never overwrites the last-good daemon cred with an unproven one: proof is a broker `preflight` (the manager's live probe, which gates every candidate when supplied) OR authority continuity (the candidate is signed by the same account key as the current broker-accepted cred — what the offline `doctor auth --fix` relies on). A same-label alternate account (full or stripped) is neither, so it is refused rather than clobbering the last-good.
  - The manager reads its signer from the injected `ManagerOptions.secretStore` (`getSpaceAuth(this.secrets, this.space)`); `up`, `mint`, `backup`, `restore`, `doctor`, `spawn`, and the delivery dev-mint helper go through the store. `loadSpaceAuth` remains the sync FS reader for name-only/presence callers and the static-auth single-machine mint composition.
  - `cotal clean all` deletes `auth/auth.json` through the store as its absolute-last step, so a partial-failure reset re-runs against the correct space.

  Closes "no signing seed at rest on a hosted disk"; the remaining hosted gap is signer isolation (the seed is still decrypted in-process at the manager's uid), not custody.

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- c3afdaa: fix(renewal): prove the broker accepted a re-signed daemon credential before reporting it adopted

  `cotal doctor auth` could report a renewal "adopted" that the broker never accepted (a false green). The daemon's credential-reload path now proves acceptance on a disposable preflight connection before it adopts, and the record + `doctor` verdict only ever claim what was proven:

  - The delivery-admin `reloadCreds` reply narrows to `brokerAccepted` (identity/iat/exp actually accepted) plus a best-effort `residentSwap`, never an unwitnessed "adopted".
  - The passive 75% renewal timer and the explicit reload share one single-flight transaction and both preflight before installing a candidate, so a rejected credential in the store can never strand the live connection.
  - The whole daemon-side transaction is deadline-bounded (under the manager's request bound) with a late-commit fence, so a hung store fails loud instead of a silent "no responder".
  - `cotal doctor auth` now exits non-zero and says so when the last renewal was refused by the broker, instead of letting cred-file health alone stand as healthy.
  - The ephemeral generation fingerprint used to bind the expected generation is redacted at the persistence boundary, so it never lands in `.cotal/renewal.json` or logs.

- 2ed747d: feat(secret-store): migrate the membership feed's rw credential onto the store seam with proven standing renewal

  The broker-sourced graph feed's data-account (rw) credential now moves as a full read/write/delete kind through the `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition can renew it end-to-end (KMS/Vault) the way `delivery.creds` already does. Local `cotal up` is byte-for-byte unchanged (the default is the workstation FS store).

  - The feed's rw connection adopts credentials the way the endpoint does: an async source read outside the (synchronous) authenticator, a preflight-proven cache, a 75%-of-lifetime renewal timer, and a single-flight transaction bounded by an absolute deadline. Its authenticator now only ever presents the last **broker-proven** credential, so an incidental reconnect can no longer present an unproven or broker-refused generation and strand the feed.
  - The renewal owner (the manager) and the daemon now share one `SecretStore`: `Manager` takes an optional `secretStore` (defaulting to the workstation FS store) that feeds `remintDaemonCreds` and every per-agent secret kind, and `startMembership` reads the rw credential through the injected store. A hosted composition that hands the manager and the delivery daemon the same store renews both daemon kinds without a restart.
  - `cotal up` writes, and `cotal clean all` deletes, `membership-rw.creds` through the seam (never a raw filesystem write/remove), matching the `delivery.creds` discipline.
  - `credsRenewalDelayMs` (the 75% renew-early convention) is shared from `identity` so the endpoint and the feed compute it identically.

- 9625ec6: Add `cotal update` to reconcile first-party connectors and extensions to one generation, report third-party extensions, and check or opt into a serialized, verified global CLI upgrade.
- 6960658: The web dashboard now ships and versions with the `cotal-ai` binary. Previously `@cotal-ai/web` was fetched separately on its own version line, so upgrading the CLI (`npm i -g cotal-ai@new`) left the dashboard stale, and the documented `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/web` could not cross the 0.x caret to reach the new release, leaving customers on an old dashboard with no clean way forward.

  web is now a bundled first-party extension alongside the connectors: it is carried inside the `cotal-ai` package and the boot reconcile installs and version-refreshes it from that bundled payload at the binary's own version. So `npm i -g cotal-ai@X` brings the dashboard to X automatically and offline on the normal upgrade path, exactly like the connectors (a deliberate operator pin or a rollback is the operator's choice, same as any connector). To make this possible, web is repackaged to be self-contained — its marked/DOMPurify browser builds are copied into its own `dist` and served from there instead of resolving `node_modules` at runtime — so it seeds with no runtime dependencies.

  The bundle path is hardened so the update stays clean and verifiable: the prepack asserts every seeded payload's `name` and `version` match the umbrella (the `fixed` group keeps them lockstep), the reconcile verifies each (re)installed extension is recorded, on disk, and at the generation version before it stamps success (a version-skewed payload fails loud), and web publishes a `vendor-manifest.json` (name/version/license/sha512) of its bundled marked/DOMPurify so the shipped browser libs stay auditable.

Local `cotal up` is unchanged (the workspace `.cotal`-rooted filesystem store lands byte-for-byte on the existing paths); a hosted composition injects its own backend via `runAuthService`/`runDelivery`. `AuthProvider` methods now take a caller-composed `store`, and the new required `deprovisionSecrets` plus `clean all`'s seam-first ordering make a full local reset safe against split authority.

### Patch Changes

- 5b2863a: feat: `cotal clean` - one configurable cleanup verb (history / store / all)

  `cotal down` deliberately preserves the on-disk JetStream store, so stale broker state (e.g.
  durables minted by an older, incompatible Cotal generation) survived every down/up cycle and made
  a new-generation `cotal spawn` fail with `consumer already exists`. `cotal clean <history|store|all>
--force` is the operator reset:

  - **history**: purge the retained message backlog on the running broker (channels, plus DMs with
    `--dms`) over the least-privilege purger cred; `cotal history clear` stays as a thin alias.
  - **store**: delete the stopped mesh's JetStream store (`.cotal/nats` or `--store-dir`).
  - **all**: store + the space identity (`.cotal/auth`), every locally persisted cred/marker tied to
    it, crash residue a normal `down` would have swept, and this root's registry entries; the next
    `up` mints a fresh identity.

  Hardening that shipped with it: one shared pidfile probe for `down`/`clean`/`status` (pid > 0
  only; EPERM reads as alive), `down` no longer erases the record of a process it cannot stop nor
  presents a failed stop as clean, registry teardown keys on the canonicalized project root
  everywhere (a named open mesh can no longer delete another mesh's entry), and stale-store failures
  plus `cotal status` now name the reset recipe.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.
