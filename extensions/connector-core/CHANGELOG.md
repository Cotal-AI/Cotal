### Minor Changes

- ae2f31b: Add the event channel, the durable substrate, and the emitter that publishes a frame.

  The per-agent event channel is `events.<owner>.<actor>`, keyed on the principal. A display name is
  not an identity: names may legally repeat, and they permit spaces, dots and mixed case, so a
  name-keyed channel fuses distinct principals onto one subject and a grant minted from that value
  authorizes both of them onto it. Keyed on the principal the mapping is injective by construction
  rather than by digest length. Resolving a channel from a display name refuses an ambiguous name
  instead of picking a match, because returning the first one shows one agent's stream under another's
  name with nothing on the wire looking wrong.

  The write-ahead log is one file and one state machine. It freezes the retry id, the expected subject
  tip, the bracket state and the source cursor before a publish, so a restart re-publishes the same
  frame rather than a new one, and a frame is either on the wire and folded into the frontier or on
  neither. It refuses the states its own writer cannot produce, since those are the states corruption
  produces.

  The durable source returns a cursor per record rather than per read, so a crash between two records
  of one batch resumes after the last record actually consumed.

  The emitter reads that source forward from the WAL's cursor, packs records into frames that provably
  fit, and appends them under an optimistic-concurrency expectation with a frozen dedup id. At startup
  it reads the chat stream's replica count and refuses to run where the ordering its retry rule depends
  on does not hold. A duplicate acknowledgement arriving on a retry is a halt, not a success: accepting
  it would advance the frontier over a frame nobody received, and neither the wire nor the consumer's
  sequence would show a gap.

  Frame sizing is measured by the endpoint that builds the envelope and sets the headers, never
  recomputed here. A splitter that sized a frame itself would be measuring the frame while the broker
  measures the message, and the part it produced would be rejected, which turns a labelled truncation
  back into a silent loss.

  One emitter writes one principal's log, and that is enforced rather than described. The lock beside
  the log is acquired and held for the life of the process, so a second start on the same principal is
  refused by name; a lock whose recorded owner is provably gone is reclaimed, so one crash does not
  leave a principal unstartable, and a record naming another host or naming nobody checkable is
  refused rather than reclaimed on a guess. A lock cannot see a handle that predates it, so every
  durable replace also carries a generation the writer bumps and verifies: a handle holding an older
  view of the document is refused instead of overwriting a newer one. Without both, two logs opened on
  one file let the loser rewrite a folded frontier to a subject sequence the broker never assigned,
  which reads back as a healthy log and wedges every later publish. The document version moves to 3
  for that generation; older documents migrate forward, and there is no downgrade.

  Nothing in production emits yet: no connector constructs an emitter, and the transcript mirror is
  untouched.

- 10d9cd6: Adopt the AG-UI event vocabulary, and give a frame a wire identity a reader can recognise.

  Cotal's agent-event stream carried glyph-prefixed text, so a consumer could display it and do nothing
  else with it. The vocabulary replaces the payload: typed events with real identities, an envelope that
  carries its own ordering, and a validator a surface can execute.

  Core gains the frame's identity: the `ag-ui.frame` part kind, the event `type` discriminators, and
  `isAguiFramePart`. It lives in core rather than in a connector because every connector emits it and
  none may redefine it, which is what makes it a protocol shape rather than an adapter's choice. What
  stays out of core is producer-side: the envelope version and every event constructor.

  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` gains the vocabulary itself: the constructors, the frame envelope,
  `parseAguiFrame`, the `AguiBrackets` stream machine, and the `cotal.*` CUSTOM table, which is empty
  in v1. `parseAguiFrame` throws with the offending field named and `isAguiFramePart` never throws,
  because routing and validity are different questions: collapsing them would make a protocol skew look
  exactly like someone else's message, and a surface would show an empty pane for a stream it was
  actively failing to parse. A protocol mismatch and an unrecognised event type are both refused rather
  than partially rendered, since a skipped event is a hole in a transcript that still looks complete.

  Bracketing is a property of a writer's stream and not of a single frame, so `AguiBrackets` is fed
  frame after frame. A frame may legally open a run and not close it.

  Nothing emits yet. The channel derivation, the payload-size split and the publishing emitter are not
  in this change, and no connector constructs a frame outside a test.

  `@ag-ui/core` is an exact-pinned, types-only devDependency: it declares zod as a runtime dependency
  and connector-core is bundled into every seeded connector, so importing it at runtime would ship a
  second zod major to every customer in order to validate events Cotal constructs itself. The
  conformance suite imports the real schemas and parses every constructor's output under the schema
  that owns it, which is what keeps the hand-written literals honest.

- a1bc784: Display an agent event frame, and separate event channels from chat.

  An `ag-ui.frame` part carries no text part by design, so every surface that renders a message as
  flat text drew one as `[unrenderable part kind "ag-ui.frame"]`. A renderer now folds a frame's
  events into readable lines: streamed text and reasoning deltas accumulate into one line rather than
  one line each, a tool call reports its name, its arguments and its result, and a stream that ended
  without its terminator is flushed and marked truncated instead of being dropped. An event type this
  build does not know is named rather than skipped, because a skipped event is a hole in a transcript
  that still looks complete. It registers through the part-renderer seam, so the standard resolves it
  by the part's own kind and never learns what the vocabulary means.

  The renderer is loaded by the composition root rather than by a connector. Connectors are removable
  extensions materialized on demand, and no surface that renders imports one, so a provider that
  registered only inside a connector would be absent from every process that draws.

  The event channel's name and its classifier move into the standard, beside the frame's identity.
  Both are things a reader needs in order to recognise an agent's stream without knowing which adapter
  produced it, and the two surfaces that most need to classify cannot reach an extension package at
  all. The constructor is re-exported from its former home, so no caller changes.

  The classifier is now a derivation rather than a prefix test, and the two disagree on names a real
  mesh produces. Nothing reserves the `events.` prefix, so a channel a human created and talks on
  answered yes to "does this start with `events.`" and was swept out of the chat pane it was sent to.
  A name that does not resolve to a principal is no longer treated as machine traffic, which returns
  those channels to the view, and leaves a malformed publisher visible rather than hidden. The
  collision is narrowed rather than closed: a chat channel whose remainder is itself principal shaped
  is still indistinguishable from an agent's stream, and closing that means reserving the prefix on
  the wire.

  The console keeps event channels out of the channel strip and out of the history prefill. The order
  matters more than the result: the channel list carries one entry per retained subject, so filtering
  after the fetch would read history for every event channel and discard it, which is unbounded work
  to display nothing. Live rows are marked rather than dropped, because hiding them would delete the
  only traffic this change taught the console to draw.

  The dashboard gains the same rendering through a per-kind lookup, so its dispatcher stays ignorant
  of every kind anyone teaches it. A renderer that throws, returns a non-string, or shares a name with
  an inherited object method is reported by name instead of blanking the body. The browser cannot
  import the shared renderer, so the two implementations are held together by an executable
  equivalence check rather than by intent.

  The example harness records a message through the shared renderer instead of keeping only its text
  parts, so a message whose content is not text is no longer written to the transcript as an empty
  string and scored as an agent that said nothing.

  No connector emits a frame yet, and no transcript mirror is removed. Display lands first on purpose:
  a cutover shipped before a renderer would replace a readable mirror with a part every surface shows
  as a marker.

- 4e8d776: The `cotal_*` tools now refuse an argument they do not model instead of silently
  dropping it. A call carrying an unmodelled key (`owner` or `actor` alongside the
  real arguments) previously succeeded with that key stripped before the tool ran,
  so the caller was told nothing and the tool did something other than what was
  asked. It is now refused by name, on every adapter and on every tool: the MCP
  renderers and pi publish a closed schema and the host rejects the call, while
  OpenCode and Hermes pass the caller's object through untouched and are closed at
  the connector's own dispatch. Tools that take no arguments are closed too: they
  were previously published with no schema at all, so a host had nothing to check
  against and forwarded the extras to be dropped, as is `cotal_inbox`, whose
  arguments four of the connectors replace with their own. Behaviourally breaking
  for any caller that was relying on extra keys being ignored. Every refusal names
  the rejected keys; where the connector is the one refusing it also lists the
  arguments the tool accepts, or says it takes none.

### Patch Changes

- 87c4130: Say what a refused publish, a goal deadline, and a class-queue split actually proved.

  A refused publish now reports itself. `nc.publish` is fire-and-forget: a caller whose credential
  does not authorize the subject gets an asynchronous answer on the _connection_, so the publish
  returns normally and the only observable is that no reply arrives. That is indistinguishable from
  an absent responder, though the two need opposite responses: mint the grant, or go find the
  responder. An instance-addressed describe made with a class-rail credential is exactly that case,
  and it read as an unresponsive manager: measured live, `ps --on <instance>` returned `no describe
reply from manager within 10000ms` against a 115ms RTT while an untargeted describe answered from
  either instance in well under a second. The describe now watches its connection for a permission
  violation on its own subject and raises `permission-denied` naming that subject, the instance rail,
  and the fact that the responder may be perfectly healthy. The watch closes its status iterator on
  every exit, so it does not leave a listener parked on the connection per resolve.

  A goal that produced no terminal in time no longer implies the goal failed. It was accepted; only
  its terminal did not arrive within the wait. Observed live: seats that reported this had already
  come up and were messaging peers, and retrying submitted a second goal that duplicated the effect.
  The message now says the deadline is on the wait rather than the work, and says not to retry on it
  alone.

  An unpinned class-queue split no longer implies the effect did not land. Describe and invoke are
  separate trips through the same anycast queue, so in a multi-instance space the instance that won
  the queue received the request and may have executed it, possibly after the error was raised. The
  core message now says so and points at `ps`/`inspect`/roster before any retry; it stops at "a call
  that addresses one instance does not split". The CLI adds `--on <instance>` as the remedy, and only
  on the commands that have the flag (`ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `spawn --detach`), which declare it to
  the shared renderer; `models`, `up` and `down` ride the same rails and split the same way, and are
  no longer told to type a flag they do not have. Absence of a pin is not evidence of the flag.

  And a split is no longer silently retried into a duplicate effect. The client recovered from
  `failed-precondition` by dropping its cached resolve and invoking again, which is a repair when the
  bound incarnation is gone but a second attempt when the error came from a different live instance
  answering the class queue: request received and answered (executed or refused; the reply does not
  say which), error raised afterwards. Re-invoking there re-issued the command automatically, while
  the error text told the operator not to retry; it is the mechanism behind one spawn producing
  several seats. The retry now happens only for commands
  whose second execution is observably indistinguishable from one: the reads and `describe`. Every
  other command surfaces the split to its caller, carrying a marker that says a responder did answer
  the request, so the caller can check before deciding. Surfacing also drops the stale bind: the
  cached resolve named an incarnation a different live instance has just answered for, and keeping it
  would send every later deliberate call on that endpoint into the same refusal, so the caller could
  verify and still never reach the live instance. Dropping it re-issues nothing; the next call is the
  caller's own.

  The same rule now covers the adjacent case, a manager restarted in the same workspace root. That
  restart keeps the logical instance id and advances its epoch, so a client that resolved before it
  gets its next answer from the same id at a later epoch: `expired`, raised after the attributed reply
  just like the split. It used to be rethrown untouched with the bind kept, so a long-lived client
  (a connector's mesh agent, the console) reached the successor on every later call, may have applied
  the effect each time, and never recovered. The stale-epoch refusal now carries the same
  responder-answered marker, the guard keys on the marker rather than the error code, and its message
  says which side is stale: a responder ahead of what the caller holds is a successor (re-resolve to
  adopt it), one behind is a superseded incarnation still answering. The old text called the caller's
  own bound epoch the responder's "current" epoch, which named the wrong side.

  That classification is an allowlist and fails closed at both levels. It is keyed by endpoint, not by
  bare command name, because the client is endpoint-agnostic and a flat list would lend the manager's
  judgement to any endpoint that happened to reuse a name; an endpoint nobody has classified has no
  repeat-safe commands, and an unlisted command is surfaced rather than repeated. `describe` is the one
  exception, and structurally so: it is served by the machinery on every endpoint and can never be
  redefined into something that mutates.

  `models` is deliberately not on that list even though it is a read command. With `{refresh: true}` it
  reaches the connector's model listing and, for OpenCode, re-fetches provider catalogs and rewrites a
  cache: the same name, in the same grant class, answering differently because of an argument the
  classification cannot see. A long-lived client invoking `models` through `invokeService` therefore
  surfaces a split rather than absorbing it in a multi-instance space; encoding per-command argument
  rules here would reintroduce exactly the fail-open shape this replaced.

  Where this table bites, precisely: it is read only by `CotalEndpoint.invokeService`, the long-lived
  client path. Its shipped callers are the connector's `cotal_*` manager tools (spawn, inspect, stop,
  despawn, purge, define-persona), `cotal spawn -f` (launch) and `cotal down -f` (despawn), whose
  splits now surface instead of being re-issued, plus the repeat-safe `ps` reads of `spawn -f`,
  `down -f` and the console, which keep absorbing them. The one-shot CLI commands (`cotal ps`,
  `cotal models`, `stop`, `attach`, `spawn --detach`) resolve fresh and invoke once on a short-lived
  connection; they had no cached bind and no retry, and are unchanged. That is the clearest statement of what the list is: a client-side
  stand-in for `effect` (SPEC 13.7), which the wire now carries and this change does not yet consult.
  The spec grew both halves after this work began: `effect` declares whether repeating a command is
  safe, and rides `protocol.v: 2`, while this tree still registers and resolves at `v: 1`, under which
  every command reads as a write. Reconciling the two is a separate change and is named here rather
  than described as absent from the wire.

  The CLI no longer prefixes every failed manager call with "no manager reachable on the ep rails".
  That verdict is stated only where the call went unanswered, as core marks it: no responder, or the
  reply deadline elapsed with nothing attributed to the request. The catalog code alone was not
  evidence of that. A manager that answers its describe with `ok:false` has the refusal rethrown under
  its own code, `unavailable` included, and a store read after an answered describe raises the same
  code; both printed as an unreachable manager while a manager was answering (reproduced live during
  review). Core now sets a detail kind on the producers that observed silence and the CLI keys on it,
  never on the code. A registry read on the caller's own side (the scatter's freeze or its reconcile)
  is a third outcome with its own line, since the managers were not the failure and may all be up. A
  refusal that states its own cause (a describe refused by the broker, a split, a stale epoch) is
  printed as it is, because the prefix contradicted it, and an unanswered `--on <instance>` names the
  instance that did not answer instead of pronouncing on the mesh (measured: three managers answering,
  one typo in `--on`, "no manager reachable"). `up`'s resume readiness poll keys on that same
  unanswered fact rather than on the message prefix.

  `ps` prints the full instance id in its multi-manager view. That view appears only where the split
  makes `--on <instance>` the one way to address a manager, and `--on` accepts nothing but the whole
  26-32 character lifecycle token, so an abbreviated header named the remedy and withheld the value
  it needed, and `--on <prefix>` was refused as a malformed token. The `stop`/`attach` seat-lookup
  miss, which lists the instances that did not answer for the same purpose, prints them whole too and
  says the id must be passed as printed. `spawn` refuses `--on` outside a detached imperative spawn: a
  foreground spawn has no manager to pin and a manifest deploy launches through the manager class
  queue, so the flag was accepted there and silently ignored. An empty `--on` (`--on ""`, an unset
  shell variable) is refused at the flag on all four commands: `ps` and the detached `spawn` carried it
  to the mint, which refused it as an invalid token, while `stop` and `attach` read it as absent and
  fell through to the seat lookup, so one input had two answers and one of them was a dropped pin.

  The peer-side manager tools stop reading silence off the catalog code too. `MeshAgent`'s manager
  invoke reported "no responder answered - a manager may be down, or this credential holds no <cmd>
  capability and the broker denied the request" for every `deadline-exceeded`, and the bare code for
  everything else. That was wrong in both directions. The broker's no-responders 503 arrives as
  `unavailable` carrying the unanswered marker, so the one case where the capability explanation is
  certain was the one case that did not get it: an agent denied a capability was told only
  "unavailable". And an answered `ok:false` describe is also `unavailable`, deliberately unmarked
  because a manager did answer -- and this surface is read by agents, where a claim of silence invites
  the retry that duplicates a spawn. Same code, opposite conditions, separated only by the marker,
  which is now what the verdict keys on.

- 82dd701: Forward `NEBIUS_API_KEY` to spawned agents: Nebius Token Factory joins the model-provider
  allow-list, so OpenCode's native `nebius` provider (and the Hermes registry) can authenticate
  from a managed spawn. Adds the Token Factory operator guide (`docs/nebius-token-factory.md`).
- 12f2df8: Refuse to stamp the connector seed store down to an older generation. A cotal older than the store's
  stamped generation used to miss the fast path, refresh nothing, and then write its own version over
  the stamp, leaving the store claiming a generation whose payloads were not the ones installed and
  making the next newer command reinstall every connector. It now fails loud before writing anything,
  naming both generations and pointing at `cotal ext seed --reset`.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ab9b4d: Move the auth plane's retirement rail off the retired `ctl` surface onto the endpoint subjects

  The auth plane served its generic "retire a lifecycle" operation on
  `ctl.auth-admin.<owner>.<actor>`, a rail the spec retires in full and states must
  not be handled. Rows written onto a deleted rail are defects rather than
  exceptions to it, so the rail moves to
  `ep.one.auth.retire-lifecycle.handle.<target triple>.<caller triple>.<nonce>`
  instead of the cut growing a carve-out.

  Two things get stronger on the way. The reply is now derived from the parsed
  request, so there is no argument through which a caller- or payload-supplied
  reply target could arrive; and the request and reply planes are disjoint, so the
  listener credential cannot express a request subject at all. The per-despawn
  requester credential now pins both its caller triple and exactly one target
  incarnation, so a leaked requester cannot be re-aimed at another lifecycle.

  Serve-time authorization additionally requires that the serve registration a
  request names belongs to the requesting principal. The previous two-token
  subject could not express the caller beyond a recyclable alias, so the rail
  accepted any registered instance's registration. This is alias-level binding:
  the registration is keyed by an id that is stable across restarts and carries no
  lifecycle uid, so a same-principal predecessor presenting the current epoch is
  still accepted.

  The spec rows also described an authorization mechanism the implementation had
  already replaced, and now describe what ships.

  This is a subject-plane migration, not a completed endpoint migration. The rail
  carries the endpoint subjects but still exchanges the pre-v0.4 request and reply
  bodies, registers no service record, serves no `describe`, and has no contract
  artifact — so a generic endpoint client can neither discover nor invoke the
  command. That gap is tracked separately, with the acceptance test being that a
  generic client can do both. The one acceptance-path hole is closed here rather
  than deferred: the request carries an id, the reply echoes it, and a reply that
  does not echo is refused, so a wrong-id success cannot clear a retirement hold.

  The requester's grant pins its target with the `handle` mode, which is normatively
  redemption-minted. This path is not: there is no issuer-signed artifact, no
  redemption step, and no lineage — the row is built directly from the minting
  manager's coordinates under root authority. It is used because it is the only
  target mode that can pin an exact incarnation, and the serve-time handler
  re-checks that triple against the current mapping. This is a documented
  deviation, not compliant handle semantics, and it is stated at the mint site and
  in the ownership matrix row. It resolves with the same tracked work as the
  envelope, since the mode and the envelope are one wire-conformance surface.

- 4d14037: `cotal_persona`: defining a persona no longer announces on the mesh by default

  Defining a persona used to post "persona X is now available — spawn it to bring it online" on the
  definer's first concrete channel — `#general` for most personas, since nothing ever chose the
  destination: the send passed no channel, so it fell through to whichever concrete channel happened
  to be first in the caller's list. Standing up a review panel therefore put one broadcast per seat
  into every peer's inbox, and the wording read as an instruction to strangers to launch an agent they
  knew nothing about, from a principal they had no relationship with.

  `cotal_persona` and `MeshAgent.definePersona` now take an optional `announce` channel:

  - **Omitted (the default): silent.** Nothing is published.
  - **Supplied: that channel only**, never one inferred from ordering, with post rights enforced by
    the broker as for any other message and no fallback. The channel is validated before the write, so
    an empty string, a wildcard, or a name the subject layer would rewrite is refused loudly rather
    than publishing somewhere you did not name.
  - The message is now a statement of what the sender did rather than an imperative aimed at the
    reader.
  - A persona whose announcement is refused is reported as **saved but not announced**, pointing at
    `allowPublish` — not as a failed definition, which named the wrong fix and invited a retry that
    posted the duplicate.

  No durable or deliberately-consultable read path is removed: `cotal personas list` / `show` read the
  catalog directly within a workspace, and `cotal_spawn` still fails loud on a name that does not
  exist. What is lost is unsolicited awareness of a bare name — real discovery, but incidental,
  incomplete (no prompt, model, or role) and invisible to anyone who joined later.

  `@cotal-ai/core` gains `isPublishPermissionDenied`, a public helper beside `isPermissionDenied` that
  is true only for a typed permission violation whose `operation` is `"publish"`. `isPermissionDenied`
  is deliberately operation-agnostic — it separates a denial from a missing service, where the
  operation is irrelevant — so it cannot answer "did this message get stored?". A JetStream publish is
  request/PubAck, and a denial on the reply-inbox _subscription_ rejects `js.publish()` while the
  stream may already hold the message. Callers that report delivery must ask the narrower question.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- c76a49d: Add the `artifact` message part: a reference to bytes too large to send.

  Every Cotal message rides one NATS message under the broker's maximum payload, so moving a file
  between agents has meant pasting bytes into chat until it breaks, or sharing a filesystem path that
  stops working the moment two agents are not on the same machine. SPEC §5 reserved the answer; this
  defines it. A message can now carry `{ kind: "artifact", name, mediaType, digest, size }` — the
  content address of the bytes, and nothing about where they live, so the store behind it can change
  without any message changing shape. This is the contract only: the transport that serves the bytes
  lands separately.

  The digest is the one field that is not taken on trust. `name`, `mediaType`, and `size` are
  whatever the sender wrote, and a receiver that sizes a buffer from `size` or dispatches on
  `mediaType` has believed a stranger; `verifyRawBytes` checks fetched bytes against the digest before
  they reach a caller, which is what catches a store handing back a truncated object — otherwise
  indistinguishable from a small one.

  `artifact` is a bare core kind rather than a namespaced extension, because reverse-DNS kinds are for
  wrapping vocabularies Cotal does not own, and this is Cotal's own reserved primitive. That
  distinction has teeth: a core kind the message validator does not know is not a schema detail. The
  validator gates the durable delivery frame, so an unrecognized core part means the backstop drops
  the whole message, silently, and the loss shows up nowhere near the part that caused it. The
  `artifact` guard is enforced there, and it checks the digest's form rather than only its type — a
  malformed digest is not a reference to anything, and admitting one would turn a bad message into a
  "missing artifact" that blames the store.

  Message rendering moves to a single `partsToText` in core. The same one-line expression had been
  copied into the connector inbox, `cotal join`, and the mesh view, and each copy fell back to
  stringifying a part's `data` field — which an artifact part does not have, so all three would have
  rendered it as the literal word "undefined". One renderer means a new core part kind is legible
  everywhere at once, or nowhere, never in two surfaces out of three.

- 019afc3: The manager control surface gains three capabilities on the v0.4 endpoint rails: spawn as an action, multi-manager instance addressing, and attach as a mesh session.

  Spawn and launch are now actions (SPEC 13.6). Asking the manager for an agent no longer blocks the caller while the process comes up: the manager accepts a spawn goal and returns the allocated identity at once (`{name, owner, actor, uid, goalId, fingerprint, executor{lifecycleUid, epoch}}`), then progress events follow the launch to a terminal outcome. Presence within the readiness window settles the goal `succeeded`, an early exit `failed`, and the window elapsing with neither is `uncertain` (a bounded, durable outcome a later `ps` settles against the live roster, never a silent hang). A persona-derived name collision auto-numbers; a hard-pinned `--name` colliding with a live agent refuses at accept, before anything is minted. The `--detach` CLI spawn, the manifest `-f` launch, and the connector's `cotal_spawn` submit and follow to the terminal, so their behavior is unchanged. The goal terminal is fenced to the executing manager's own gate epoch (the terminal lands on an epoch-scoped result subject), so a superseded incarnation's terminal is invisible to current readers; a durable reconcile index lets a restarted manager settle any goal a predecessor accepted but never terminalized. The goal-fact writer is a dedicated, family-staged, renewed credential disjoint from the serve credential.

  One space can now run more than one manager. Each manager persists a stable logical instance id across restarts and advances its process epoch when it comes back, so peers address a specific manager regardless of which process currently serves it; a restart re-registers the same instance and evicts its predecessor's serve family through a scoped, one-registration eviction credential. `cotal spawn --on <instance>` pins one instance by its exact id, an untargeted spawn rides class anycast (the acceptance records which instance took it), and `cotal ps` / `status` become a class scatter that merges every registered instance's rows with per-instance attribution and labels a non-answering instance unreachable, never omitting it. The manager lease is demoted from a per-space singleton to per-instance liveness (loss stops only that instance's serving, never the space), reconcile touches only rows the instance owns, and the retirement rail authorizes on the registration gate rather than a name-derived holder, so a deposed predecessor cannot retire a target.

  `cotal attach` no longer returns a `127.0.0.1` websocket URL. It creates a one-use, holder-bound session over the mesh: the reply carries a signed session grant (no URL, never logged), redeemed once, after which terminal bytes stream on session subjects scoped to the two parties, with backpressure surfaced as an explicit drop notice. A late attach still repaints the full screen from a replayed terminal snapshot, and close, expiry, target despawn, and manager restart are distinct, surfaced end states. The browser console is now a real mesh session client over a served bundle (the broker gains a localhost-default websocket listener), holding only a per-session, rails-only credential that expires with the session. The manager's session writer is a scoped, family-staged, renewed credential over a dedicated sessions store.

- f85ffbf: The manager now registers itself as an ordinary v0.4 `service` endpoint (`manager`) on every static auth mesh and dual-serves its FULL typed command surface on the endpoint rails beside the existing control tiers — nothing removed yet. The served commands mirror every control op through the same handler cores: `status`, `ps`, `inspect` (per-agent read), `models`, `spawn` (the full 16-field launch surface), targeted owner-mode `despawn`/`attach`, the baseline self-mode `stop`, `define-persona`, `purge`, `launch`, the resume/preservation family, and the reserved `describe`. `ps`/`inspect`/`spawn` replies now also carry each agent's `lifecycleUid` (the coordinate a targeted request pins). Core gains the production endpoint-serve credential subsystem over the durable auth store: the §13.1 endpoint issuance gate and serve ledger (`epgate…`/`epcred…`), the registration barrier with fail-closed eviction, and the serve-mint release fence — plus a key-pinned one-shot `endpoint-serve-executor` credential profile scoped to exactly one endpoint instance's gate, serve-ledger family, and registration record keys. The manager drives its registration and every serve-credential mint and renewal through that scoped executor connection (never its standing supervisor connection), applies one shared lifecycle-membership + maintenance admission gate on both control doors (the legacy `ctl` tiers and the new endpoint rails), and renews its bounded serve credential on the standing renewal pass. Registration also publishes the manager's §13.7 contract artifacts — every command's schema root, its closure manifest, and the cluster document — to the per-space content-addressed contract store (created create-or-verify at manager start alongside the authority stores), and every agent credential's baseline now carries the store's read grant, so any caller can fetch, verify, and recompile the registered schema digests without out-of-band contract sharing.

  The control CONSUMERS now ride those rails (static-auth meshes): every CLI manager call (`spawn --detach`, `ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `models`, `down`/`up`'s resume and preservation phases) and every connector supervision tool (`cotal_spawn`/`cotal_despawn`/`cotal_persona`, self-stop, history purge) goes through the generic invoke path - describe, fetch the registered schemas from the contract store, recompile digest-verified validators, invoke - instead of hand-importing the manager's contracts; invoke currency is describe-bound (the answering incarnation's broker-authenticated identity), so a superseded or split-brain manager refuses instead of answering stale. New `cotal describe <endpoint>` and `cotal invoke <endpoint> <command>` expose the same generic surface to operators. Operator reach is now minted, not door-refined: `control-caller-privileged`/`control-caller-admin`/`deployer` instrument credentials carry tier-matched endpoint capability rows (the admin tier's cross-agent `despawn`/`attach` ride the operator-only `any` authorization mode, declared in the manager's revision-3 cluster document), the spawn capability additionally mints `define-persona` + `inspect`, and an `admin`-capability credential mirrors the full admin instrument set. Open meshes and user-mode bearers kept the legacy `ctl` path until the final slice below.

  User-mode meshes join the migration end to end: the manager registers its v0.4 service on per-user meshes too (the registration/serve machinery is operator infrastructure riding the space's static trust material), the CLI's bearer path derives its caller triple from the bearer's ledger lifecycle claim, the connector's endpoint identity is its triple in every auth mode (no ctl branch left in the connector), and `spawn -f`'s deploy probe drives `ps`/`launch` over the generic invoke path for both the static admin credential and the user-mode deployer view. Serve-side hardening: every `manager.admin`-class command (purge, launch, and the resume/preservation family) re-checks operator reach at serve time against the caller's CURRENT ledger scope on user meshes, so a revoked `admin` scope demotes the next call instead of riding out the bearer's remaining row lifetime.

  The migration is now complete: the manager's legacy `ctl` control rail is deleted. Core drops the `manager`/`self`/`admin` control tiers, the `ControlTier` type, and `controlSubject`; the server-side `ctl.delivery`/`ctl.delivery-admin`/`ctl.auth-admin` rails (the delivery daemon's and auth service's own carve-outs) are unchanged. Every credential profile is endpoint-only: agent baselines lose the `ctl.self` publish and control-reply subscribe rows, the supervisor serves no control tier, and the operator instruments carry endpoint capability rows only, so the old manager control subjects are unreachable end to end (publish rows, serve subscriptions, and handlers are all gone). The manager registers its `service` endpoint on EVERY mesh: auth meshes ride the scoped endpoint-serve executor; open meshes run the same gate/registration/serve-grant ceremony over bare one-shot connections (no credential is ever minted; the broker enforces nothing on an open mesh) and create-or-verify the authority stores at boot, so a raw broker no longer dies at the first gate write. The CLI's control layer replaces `ControlTier` with `ControlReach` (`owner`/`any`): the target's authorization mode derives from the resolved target owner (an own-domain target rides owner mode; a cross-owner target rides any mode, which the broker admits only for admin-instrument holders), open meshes ride a bare caller triple, and a raw `--creds` control caller without an endpoint caller identity refuses loud instead of falling back. `ps`/`inspect` rows pin `role` as optional (a manifest-launched agent declares none, and the reply schema previously failed the responder's own output).

- 185e721: Renew the `$SYS` credentials without tearing the space down.

  `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are signed by
  the system-account seed, which is never persisted, so nothing re-signs them in place. The only
  repair the tooling named was "`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`", and that did nothing: `up`
  mints the pair only on the branch that _creates_ the trust record, so re-upping a provisioned space
  reused the same expired files and reported success. A long-running mesh therefore lost its
  membership feed and live connection eviction every 30 days with no supported way back.

  `cotal up --rotate-sys` is that way back. It issues a new system account under the same broker
  operator, mints both `$SYS` creds against it, and renders the broker config from the rotated record,
  so the broker it starts is the one that trusts them. The data account, the account signing key,
  every agent credential minted from it and the JetStream store are untouched; what dies is the
  retired system account, on every broker that loads the rotated config. It is refused wherever the
  on-disk material and the broker could end up on different generations: a running mesh; an open mesh,
  whether that comes from `--open` or from `broker.auth: false` in a manifest; `--restore`; an
  unfinished restore or resume attempt on the root, including one a bare `cotal up` would recover,
  since those paths can adopt a live listener and return without booting a broker; and a root hosting
  more than one space, because the system account lives in the shared broker record and the rotation is
  therefore broker-wide. `rotateSystemCreds` is exported from `@cotal-ai/workspace` and carries the
  multi-tenant guard itself rather than at the CLI flag. It is deliberately a workstation operation and
  takes no `SecretStore`: the `$SYS` pair has no store seam to be written through, and because a
  `SecretStore` cannot be enumerated, accepting one would mean a broker-wide guard that reads a local
  filesystem while enforcing nothing for the tenants actually at risk.

  A rotation requires every broker for the root to be stopped, and three checks now say so: this root's
  recorded mesh at the requested address, anything unidentified answering there (which refuses instead
  of relocating to a free port), and the root's own ownership records: a live or unreadable `nats.pid`,
  or any recorded mesh for this root still reachable. Without them a lost registry row, or a
  `nats-server` started by hand against this root's `server.conf`, was enough to bypass the running-mesh
  refusal: `up` found the port busy, picked a free one, rotated, and left the old broker serving the
  retired config while a second one ran against the same JetStream store. These are Cotal's ownership
  records rather than a scan of the process table, and the docs say so: a hand-started broker on a
  different port writes none of them and is the named residual.

  Two consequences the tooling now states rather than leaving to be discovered. The retirement is
  config-load-bound, so a stale broker still running the previous config keeps honouring the old creds
  until it is stopped. And a full backup binds to the trust chain it was taken against, which includes
  the operator JWT and the system account, so every full artifact taken before a rotation refuses to
  restore afterwards: the rotation says so as it happens, and `cotal up --restore` names the drift when
  the data account still matches. The commit is a trust-record write plus two credential writes, so an
  interrupted rotation leaves the record ahead of the creds; that split is detected rather than
  silent. One shared check compares each `$SYS` cred's issuer against the persisted record, and it
  runs on every auth-mesh boot as well as in `cotal doctor auth`, so the state cannot pass unremarked
  by a mesh that simply never runs the doctor. The boot REFUSES rather than warning: a warning becomes an unread log line
  under `--detach`'s success output, and live connection eviction rides the same credential pair, so
  booting would silently downgrade revocation to deny-new for the life of the mesh. The delivery daemon, which never
  loads the signer and so cannot read the record, compares the two creds against each other instead.

  The recovery is covered end-to-end as well as in unit form: a suite drives the packaged binary
  against a real broker, a real delivery daemon and a real manager, on a root whose `$SYS` pair is
  already past its horizon. It asserts the reported symptom (the daemon's membership feed does not
  start, and says which credential and which repair), that `down` + a plain `up` leaves both files
  byte-identical and the doctor red, and that `down` + `up --rotate-sys` clears it in the daemon that
  reported it. The survival claim is checked rather than asserted: an agent credential minted before
  the rotation still connects afterwards, the CHAT stream returns at the same sequence and count, and
  registry state written before the rotation reads back through the CLI after it.

  Diagnosis now names the cause instead of the symptom. An expired observer cred used to surface as a
  bare "Authorization Violation" in the delivery log and, one layer up, as a `membership-rw` adoption
  refused with "membership feed is not running", neither of which mentions a credential. The daemon
  checks the observer's own expiry before connecting and reports it, carries that reason into the
  adoption reply, and the manager warns on every renewal pass from the 75% point onward rather than
  letting the mesh discover the expiry at the horizon. `cotal doctor auth`, `evictPrincipal`,
  `planeConnLiveness` and the two mint errors now print the repair that works. Where the feed is down
  because its bundle is incomplete rather than expired, the daemon now names the missing files and
  distinguishes the two cases: a missing `$SYS` observer is re-minted by a rotation, while a space
  predating broker-sourced membership is missing the rw cred and the account id as well, which a
  rotation does not write, so it is told the truth rather than sent through a stop/start that cannot
  help it.

### Patch Changes

- a306df0: Never consume a Claude Code peer's message without delivering it.

  An unattended agent could go permanently silent after a direct message. The connector's lifecycle
  hook acked the message and marked it handled while it was still only _formatting_ the hook reply
  that carries it, but that reply has to reach the runtime through the hook relay, which abandons the
  exchange after two seconds. When it did not land, the agent's model never saw the message while the
  connector had already committed it — and because the message was recorded as handled, its own
  JetStream redelivery was acked and discarded on arrival, so nothing could bring it back. The peer
  simply stopped answering, and only a human noticed.

  A message is now committed only once the reply carrying it has cleared both legs of its journey, not
  just the first. The hook relay confirms back to the connector only after its own write to the
  runtime has completed cleanly, and the connector waits for that receipt
  (`startControlServer` gains an additive `onReply(event, delivered)`, and a client opts in with
  `handoff: true`); anything less leaves the message un-acked, so it redelivers and the agent is woken
  again. Binding to the connector's own socket write was not enough: a large injection that the
  relay's one-second flush backstop kills mid-write reaches nothing, and the batch was still
  committed. The verdict is tracked per hook event rather than in one slot, because hook frames are
  separate connections that can overlap and would otherwise let one frame's outcome commit another
  frame's messages. This errs toward delivering twice rather than losing one: a re-surfaced batch is
  flagged as a possible repeat.

  Two further ways the same path could go quiet are closed. Presence updates no longer gate delivery —
  a failed presence write used to skip both the message injection and the end-of-turn flush of
  anything held while the agent was busy. And a rejected wake notification is now retried with a
  bounded backoff, since for an idle agent it is the only thing that can wake it.

- a26e5f2: Always answer an authenticated control-plane client, whether or not anyone observes delivery.

  The reply write sat inside an optional call's argument list:

  ```ts
  opts.onReply?.(ev, await writeReply(sock, reply, awaitHandoff));
  ```

  Optional chaining short-circuits the entire call expression when the callback is absent, arguments
  included, so `writeReply` was never evaluated for any caller that does not pass `onReply`. The
  handler still ran and still saw the event; only the client saw the silence, then timed out. Of the
  five callers of `startControlServer`, only the Claude Code adapter passes `onReply`, so the opencode
  and hermes hook relays got no reply to any control frame, and the pi and codex adapters lost the
  error reply they answer non-shutdown ops with. Cooperative shutdown was unaffected: it is acked on a
  separate synchronous path.

  Writing the reply is the server's job; `onReply` only watches it. The write is now performed first
  and its verdict passed to the callback, so the two are no longer coupled.

  Covered by a new broker-free suite, `smoke:control-reply`, which drives each of the four production
  opts shapes and asserts the reply arrives. Mutation-proved by restoring the short-circuit, which
  reddens the no-callback cases while the "handler ran" cell still passes, which is precisely the
  asymmetry that made this invisible from the server side.

  The one suite that did catch it, `smoke:windows`, is Windows-only, and its red had been merged past
  repeatedly. The new suite runs on POSIX and is in `smoke:ci`.

## 0.16.0

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f89560a: New Codex connector (`--agent codex`): an OpenAI Codex session as a full lateral mesh peer, in Codex's own TUI. A host-mode peer drives a `codex app-server` thread over JSON-RPC: inbound batches wake a real turn, and directed messages steer INTO a live turn mid-flight.

  `cotal spawn --agent codex` opens Codex's own TUI. The app-server runs as a loopback websocket listener guarded by a per-incarnation capability token (0600, inside the agent's private home), and the TUI attaches to the very thread the mesh drives, so mesh turns render as they happen and anything you type is a real user turn on that same thread. With no terminal (piped output, CI, a smoke) the host stays headless with an activity feed instead; `COTAL_CODEX_TUI=1|0` picks the mode explicitly when the tty check would guess wrong. Once Codex owns the terminal the host's own log moves to `host.log` in the agent's private home, and the handoff line names that path so a later failure is findable.

  The shared `cotal_*` tools are served by the host process itself over a bearer-authenticated loopback MCP endpoint, with the token passed to codex by env var name so it never reaches the process table. Because the app-server is the MCP client, the same tools work on a mesh-driven turn and on one typed into the TUI; the connector's own tools are pre-approved so an unattended agent never stalls on an approval prompt nobody is watching, and `mcp_servers.cotal.*` is reserved and refused rather than silently overridden.

  Autonomy defaults suit an agent woken by peer messages when nobody is watching: `approval_policy=never` (never ask before running a command, not refuse), `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, and `sandbox_workspace_write={network_access=true}`. Network is on because Codex's own workspace-write default has it off, which breaks installing a dependency or pushing a branch with an error that reads like the task is impossible rather than the sandbox refusing; filesystem containment is kept, because a peer's message is a remote input that can make the agent run commands. The network default is applied only where the sandbox is actually `workspace-write`, so tightening the mode does not leave a network grant in the launch. All three are overridable per spawn with `--opt` (including `sandbox_mode=danger-full-access` for no sandbox at all), while an interactive `approval_policy` is refused loud rather than auto-answered on the operator's behalf.

  The guide states the sandbox's guarantee literally: it blocks out-of-workspace local filesystem writes, and does not block reads, exfiltration, or networked side effects. With the network on, a peer-driven turn can read broadly and send what it reads, reach loopback and link-local services, and act through any credential it can read, including irreversibly, via a force-push or an API delete. Containing filesystem writes is not the same as containing damage, and the docs say so rather than implying the residual is disclosure-only. The offline, tighter-mode, and separate-OS-user mitigations are named in both the autonomy section and Limits.

  At-least-once delivery with exact-id acks on turn completion: a failed turn retries with backoff, an interrupt redelivers, and an app-server crash restarts the child in place on the same mesh lifecycle and re-drives the un-acked batch (a crash loop is fatal, never an endless respawn). Presence from the event stream, an opt-in transcript mirror, model catalog + reasoning-effort variants (`cotal models --agent codex`, `--variant`), `--opt` passthrough to codex `-c` config overrides, and a private per-agent `CODEX_HOME` (operator config/hooks/MCP servers never load; auth.json symlinked; trust writes never touch the operator's config). Unwired options fail loud: `--resume` (a resumed codex thread comes up without its configured MCP servers, so the agent would be mute on the mesh) and tool-sharing.

  Also fixes the seed reconciler, which treated a generation match alone as up-to-date: a built-in connector added at an unchanged generation would never seed on an already-installed workstation (`--agent codex` reporting no connector installed). Both fast paths now also require every `SEED_BUILTINS` entry to be present in the ever-seeded set.

  A connector can now declare `launchHint`, the one line a foreground `cotal spawn` prints about what to expect next. That text used to be hard-coded to Claude Code's first-run gate for every agent type, telling operators of other harnesses to press Enter at a prompt that never appears.

  The web dashboard gains Codex branding (the OpenAI mark, from Simple Icons), so a codex agent renders with an icon and a label instead of a blank badge. That map was hand-maintained with nothing tying it to the connector set, so it is now covered by a test: every official connector must have a complete entry, and a new connector cannot ship icon-less with a green suite again.

### Patch Changes

- fce3199: Report which machine an agent runs on, and fix three defects that only appear once a mesh spans hosts.

  **`meta.host` on the agent card.** A mesh can span machines: a manager on another box launches
  agents into its own host, so "where is this agent actually running" was unanswerable from the
  roster. Each session now publishes its own `os.hostname()` as `meta.host`, overlaid last like
  `meta.connector` so an agent file cannot claim a host it is not on. It is advisory display
  metadata only, never an authorization or routing input, and the dashboard renders it with no
  change (unknown meta keys already display generically). `SPEC.md` records it alongside the other
  reserved `meta` keys.

  **`cotal up --host <addr>` killed the broker it had just started.** The bind address and the
  broker URL were tracked independently, so `--host` bound one address while the readiness probe
  still used the loopback default. The probe found nothing, timed out, and the caller SIGTERM'd a
  broker that had started correctly, which made `--host` alone impossible to use. The two are now
  reconciled: with no explicit `--server`, the URL is derived from the host; a contradicting pair is
  refused with one sentence instead of starting something unreachable; and wildcard binds
  (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) correctly keep a dialable loopback URL rather than advertising the wildcard. The
  manifest path (`broker.host` without `broker.servers`) had the same defect and shares the fix.

  **One slow probe silently unregistered a live mesh.** `pruneStaleMeshes` deleted any registry
  entry that failed a single reachability check whose budget is 1s, which a healthy broker across a
  slow or jittery link misses routinely. Deletion is destructive and, for a mesh this machine did
  not start, unrecoverable, since only `cotal up` writes registry records. A first failure now only
  makes an entry a candidate; it is pruned only if a second, longer probe also fails. A genuinely
  dead mesh still prunes.

  **A timed-out request killed the whole dashboard.** `cotal web` passed an async listener to
  `createServer`, so a rejection inside any route (for example a JetStream call timing out against a
  slow broker) became an unhandled rejection and took the process down on the first slow request.
  The dashboard is a read-only observer: a failing route now returns 500 and the server stays up.

## 0.14.2

## 0.14.1

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

### Patch Changes

- 8aee34e: Distribute Cotal's authored Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`), starting with `team-topology`, from one canonical source in the CLI package to every AI coding harness, with real central update and removal.

  - **Claude Code:** a skills-only `cotal-skills` plugin in the existing `cotal-mesh` marketplace, installed at user scope and independent of the mesh connector (it carries no code and no core dependency). Its plugin version is stamped from the running CLI release and `cotal setup` runs `claude plugin update`, so an upgrade actually replaces the cached skill; each plugin dir is rebuilt from an allowlist and swapped in, never merged, so no stale file rides in. It installs on first run and, fail-loud, on repeat runs, so upgraders are not left behind, and the install is verified via `claude plugin list --json` (exact id, scope/project, enabled, no errors, and expected version). `cotal status` gains a "Claude skills" row.
  - **Every other harness** (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Windsurf/Devin): `cotal setup` reconciles the cross-vendor `~/.agents/skills/` directory at the file level, tracked by a validated manifest under `~/.cotal`. Cotal owns exactly each skill's `SKILL.md`: before overwriting a copy you have edited it copies your version into a fresh `SKILL.md.bak` slot (never overwriting an existing or third-party backup), and on removal deletes only that file (then the dir if it is left empty), never a whole directory, never a user's other files, and never a third-party skill. Every managed write (skill file and ownership manifest) goes through a stage-and-rename with an exclusively-created temp (so a hard-linked or symlinked path is replaced, never written through to an outside inode), and a malformed or corrupt manifest fails loud. `cotal status` reports current/stale/missing/retired for the drop and current/stale/missing/broken for the Claude plugin.
  - The website Agent Skills discovery index is generated from the same canonical files and reconciled (a removed skill stops being served/indexed); a forward bet on the draft RFC, which no shipping harness consumes yet.

  A corrupt or empty skills bundle fails loud rather than silently shipping zero skills.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 9e3fdd6: cli: make installed extensions discoverable. Bare `cotal ext` now lists the inventory instead of erroring; `cotal ext list` and the `cotal status` Extensions section lead with the install prefix and state it is a cotal-owned store kept separate from npm's global tree (which is why `npm list -g` never shows these); a new `cotal ext root` prints just the path for scripts, and `status` always renders the section with an explicit empty state. Discoverability only: where extensions install and how they upgrade is unchanged.
- 666a1a1: docs: a new Connectors page compares every connector feature-by-feature (binding, install, TUI, delivery, resume, tool-sharing, models, containers), and the pi guide moves from Agent frameworks to Connect pi so it sits beside the other connector guides (the site redirects `/agent-frameworks` to `/connect-pi`). The bundled `cotal_docs` pages are regenerated to match.
- 9625ec6: Add `cotal update` to reconcile first-party connectors and extensions to one generation, report third-party extensions, and check or opt into a serialized, verified global CLI upgrade.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 5fb7b23: Add `cotal -v` / `cotal --version`: print the binary version plus each installed extension's, then exit. `cotal status` gains the same report — the Machine section leads with the `cotal-ai` version, and a new Extensions section lists each installed extension with its pinned version, so version skew across the seeded connectors is visible at a glance.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 046f485: Re-announce an unacked durable message on JetStream redelivery, so a wake the host dropped (e.g. during Claude's channel startup window) recovers at the next redelivery instead of leaving the agent a zombie until an unrelated message arrives.

- 1935221: Ship the built-in agent connectors (claude, opencode, hermes, pi) as removable `cotal ext` plugins. They are seeded on first run through the same `ext add` path a third party uses, resolved lazily per spawn, and deletable with `cotal ext remove`; they are no longer hardcoded imports or dependencies of `cotal-ai`.
- 5634ae4: Keep quiet-channel ambient traffic pull-only across every connector.

### Patch Changes

- 5b2863a: feat: `cotal clean` - one configurable cleanup verb (history / store / all)

  `cotal down` deliberately preserves the on-disk JetStream store, so stale broker state (e.g.
  durables minted by an older, incompatible Cotal generation) survived every down/up cycle and made
  a new-generation `cotal spawn` fail with `consumer already exists`. `cotal clean <history|store|all>
--force` is the operator reset:

  - **history**: purge the retained message backlog on the running broker (channels, plus DMs with
    `--dms`) over the least-privilege purger cred; `cotal history clear` stays as a thin alias.
  - **store**: delete the stopped mesh's JetStream store (`.cotal/nats` or `--store-dir`).
  - **all**: store + the space identity (`.cotal/auth`), every locally persisted cred/marker tied to
    it, crash residue a normal `down` would have swept, and this root's registry entries; the next
    `up` mints a fresh identity.

  Hardening that shipped with it: one shared pidfile probe for `down`/`clean`/`status` (pid > 0
  only; EPERM reads as alive), `down` no longer erases the record of a process it cannot stop nor
  presents a failed stop as clean, registry teardown keys on the canonicalized project root
  everywhere (a named open mesh can no longer delete another mesh's entry), and stale-store failures
  plus `cotal status` now name the reset recipe.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- e3a53e3: Add a connector-agnostic model/variant selector: the `cotal models` command, a `--variant` flag on spawn, and the core `listModels` / `ModelCatalog` + `LaunchOpts.variant` contract. OpenCode discovers its models and variants from the installed CLI; Claude and Hermes reject variants (fail loud) and set `COTAL_MODEL` when a model is given.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c40280: Release the 0.10 line with the onboarding and local-stack work since 0.9.1:

  - Rework the CLI around dispatcher-parsed commands, operator-installed extensions (`cotal ext`), and extension-packaged web/demo surfaces.
  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

## 0.9.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- a10ed79: OpenCode connector: mirror each agent's session transcript to its per-agent `tr-<name>` channel, event-driven from the plugin's in-process bus events (`message.updated` / `message.part.updated` / `session.idle`) — parity with the Claude connector, with no per-turn session refetch. The `tr-<name>` channel convention is exposed through the `Connector` contract (`Connector.transcriptChannel`) so the manager can grant the agent's publish ACL without the channel literal living in `@cotal-ai/core`, and the manager forwards control-plane `capabilities` (`COTAL_CAPABILITIES`) so a manifest-spawned agent exposes the `cotal_spawn` / `cotal_persona` tools its creds already authorize. Adds an end-to-end smoke for the mirror (`smoke:opencode-transcript`).

## 0.8.2

## 0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 58f2d41: Self-serve channel join + durable backstop (SPEC v0.3 delivery rebuild)

  Agents whose read ACL allows a channel now join/leave its **live** feed themselves over a native NATS core subscription — manager-free, broker-enforced by `sub.allow` (join = subscribe, leave = unsubscribe). A manager-hosted **Plane-3 durable backstop** (a privileged fan-out writer → a trusted reader that re-authorizes every entry against the current read ACL and membership interval → a per-member DELIVER durable the agent acks natively, SPEC §8) ensures a post still reaches a busy or offline agent on its next turn. Channel membership moves to a privileged cursored KV registry (`cotal_members_<space>`), and channels carry explicit `live`/`durable` delivery classes (default `durable`; a space with no manager is live-only).

  The legacy per-instance `chat_<id>` live-tail durable and the mediated filter-move are removed — one clean model with no coexistence code. This is a wire-protocol change (SPEC bumped to v0.3): new and old clients do not interoperate on channel delivery.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 878f406: Persona ownership, env allow-list, MCP sharing, and the reconnect tool

  - **`definePersona` content/policy split** with a write-once persistent file owner: a peer can't
    grant itself a capability or seize ownership of a persona file, and a persona-only edit can't
    silently clear an existing model. `role` is spawn-time policy and has been removed from the
    `cotal_persona` tool surface (advertising it was a silent no-op).
  - **Spawned-child env allow-list** (`launch.ts`): runtimes receive only the declared env, never
    `process.env`, with per-connector model-key forwarding.
  - **Opt-in per-connector MCP server sharing** for spawned agents.
  - **`cotal_reconnect`** tool added to the shared tool surface (renders on both Claude Code and
    OpenCode) for manual mesh recovery. `cotal_purge` is dropped from the agent tool surface — it
    is admin-only now, so the operator path is `cotal history clear`.
  - Agent transcript mirroring is now opt-in (default off); a spawn permission denial names the
    missing capability instead of blaming the manager.

## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 73b030f: Add the `cotal_feedback` sender: a connector tool (always exposed) and a `cotal feedback "<summary>"` CLI mode. With a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` feedback routes to the keyed broker intake as before; without one it goes to the public intake at `https://cotal.ai/v1/feedback`, which requires a contact email (`COTAL_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` → git config → ask). `COTAL_FEEDBACK_URL` overrides either URL for self-hosted intakes.
- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).

- 246c9b9: Add the `cotal_feedback` beta egress: a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` config plus `feedbackLine()` guidance folded into the Claude/Codex connector instructions, and a `cotal feedback` authenticated intake server (tester keys, JSONL source of truth, republish to an internal `#feedback` channel). Note: the agent-side `cotal_feedback` tool registration is still pending.
- 246c9b9: Add the OpenCode connector. It launches a watchable `opencode` TUI bound to the agent's session — a headless `opencode serve` with the mesh plugin loaded, plus a foreground `opencode attach --session <id>` — drives that visible session via `session.promptAsync`, and renders the `cotal_*` tools as native plugin tools at Claude-Code parity. The tool surface is extracted into `cotalToolSpecs` in connector-core so the Claude/Codex MCP adapters and the OpenCode plugin render the same tools.
