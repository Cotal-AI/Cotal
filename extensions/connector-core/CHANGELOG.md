- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 58f2d41: Self-serve channel join + durable backstop (SPEC v0.3 delivery rebuild)

  Agents whose read ACL allows a channel now join/leave its **live** feed themselves over a native NATS core subscription — manager-free, broker-enforced by `sub.allow` (join = subscribe, leave = unsubscribe). A manager-hosted **Plane-3 durable backstop** (a privileged fan-out writer → a trusted reader that re-authorizes every entry against the current read ACL and membership interval → a per-member DELIVER durable the agent acks natively, SPEC §8) ensures a post still reaches a busy or offline agent on its next turn. Channel membership moves to a privileged cursored KV registry (`cotal_members_<space>`), and channels carry explicit `live`/`durable` delivery classes (default `durable`; a space with no manager is live-only).

  The legacy per-instance `chat_<id>` live-tail durable and the mediated filter-move are removed — one clean model with no coexistence code. This is a wire-protocol change (SPEC bumped to v0.3): new and old clients do not interoperate on channel delivery.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 878f406: Persona ownership, env allow-list, MCP sharing, and the reconnect tool

  - **`definePersona` content/policy split** with a write-once persistent file owner: a peer can't
    grant itself a capability or seize ownership of a persona file, and a persona-only edit can't
    silently clear an existing model. `role` is spawn-time policy and has been removed from the
    `cotal_persona` tool surface (advertising it was a silent no-op).
  - **Spawned-child env allow-list** (`launch.ts`): runtimes receive only the declared env, never
    `process.env`, with per-connector model-key forwarding.
  - **Opt-in per-connector MCP server sharing** for spawned agents.
  - **`cotal_reconnect`** tool added to the shared tool surface (renders on both Claude Code and
    OpenCode) for manual mesh recovery. `cotal_purge` is dropped from the agent tool surface — it
    is admin-only now, so the operator path is `cotal history clear`.
  - Agent transcript mirroring is now opt-in (default off); a spawn permission denial names the
    missing capability instead of blaming the manager.

### Minor Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 73b030f: Add the `cotal_feedback` sender: a connector tool (always exposed) and a `cotal feedback "<summary>"` CLI mode. With a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` feedback routes to the keyed broker intake as before; without one it goes to the public intake at `https://cotal.ai/v1/feedback`, which requires a contact email (`COTAL_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` → git config → ask). `COTAL_FEEDBACK_URL` overrides either URL for self-hosted intakes.
- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 246c9b9: Add the `cotal_feedback` beta egress: a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` config plus `feedbackLine()` guidance folded into the Claude/Codex connector instructions, and a `cotal feedback` authenticated intake server (tester keys, JSONL source of truth, republish to an internal `#feedback` channel). Note: the agent-side `cotal_feedback` tool registration is still pending.
- 246c9b9: Add the OpenCode connector. It launches a watchable `opencode` TUI bound to the agent's session — a headless `opencode serve` with the mesh plugin loaded, plus a foreground `opencode attach --session <id>` — drives that visible session via `session.promptAsync`, and renders the `cotal_*` tools as native plugin tools at Claude-Code parity. The tool surface is extracted into `cotalToolSpecs` in connector-core so the Claude/Codex MCP adapters and the OpenCode plugin render the same tools.
