### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

### Patch Changes

- 1935221: Ship the built-in agent connectors (claude, opencode, hermes, pi) as removable `cotal ext` plugins. They are seeded on first run through the same `ext add` path a third party uses, resolved lazily per spawn, and deletable with `cotal ext remove`; they are no longer hardcoded imports or dependencies of `cotal-ai`.

## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- 1a954e8: Add the Pi host-native connector with confirmed custom-message delivery, cooperative shutdown, and a standalone extension artifact.
