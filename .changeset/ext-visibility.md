cli: make installed extensions discoverable. Bare `cotal ext` now lists the inventory instead of erroring; `cotal ext list` and the `cotal status` Extensions section lead with the install prefix and state it is a cotal-owned store kept separate from npm's global tree (which is why `npm list -g` never shows these); a new `cotal ext root` prints just the path for scripts, and `status` always renders the section with an explicit empty state. Discoverability only: where extensions install and how they upgrade is unchanged.
