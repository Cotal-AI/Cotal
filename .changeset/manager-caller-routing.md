Route user-auth manager calls through a short-lived, instance-bound control credential. Discovery and invocation address the same authorized manager while the agent's standing connection, credentials and conversation remain unchanged. Managed launches retain their manager selection across launch and resume. Static and open mesh routing is unchanged. Confirm the standing goal-progress subscription at the broker before submitting on the separate control connection, so fast terminal events cannot outrun the subscription. Recover accepted goal results through the manager's caller-scoped `goal-result` command after connection replacement, without repeating the mutation or granting clients raw JetStream reads. Followed calls now require a compatible manager before submission; update the issuer, participant manager and client together. Stopping a caller cancels its observation without cancelling the accepted goal. Retain Linux custody records across clean child exit so retirement can prove process identity and finish cleanup even after the custodian removes its file; socket loss alone never frees the alias.
