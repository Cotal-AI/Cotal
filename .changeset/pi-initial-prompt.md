`cotal spawn --agent pi --prompt <text>` now delivers the prompt as Pi's initial message (its first turn) instead of silently dropping it; an empty prompt, or one starting with `-` or `@`, refuses the launch. The connector contract no longer describes an initial prompt as something a connector may ignore: a connector delivers it or throws at launch.
