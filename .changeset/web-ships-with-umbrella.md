The web dashboard now ships and versions with the `cotal-ai` binary. Previously `@cotal-ai/web` was fetched separately on its own version line, so upgrading the CLI (`npm i -g cotal-ai@new`) left the dashboard stale, and the documented `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/web` could not cross the 0.x caret to reach the new release, leaving customers on an old dashboard with no clean way forward.

web is now a bundled first-party extension alongside the connectors: it is carried inside the `cotal-ai` package and the boot reconcile installs and version-refreshes it from that bundled payload at the binary's own version. So `npm i -g cotal-ai@X` brings the dashboard to X automatically, offline, with no version skew, exactly like the connectors. To make this possible, web is repackaged to be self-contained — its marked/DOMPurify browser builds are copied into its own `dist` and served from there instead of resolving `node_modules` at runtime — so it seeds with no runtime dependencies.
